# Time Series Analysis and ARIMA Forecasting for Demand Data

This project consists of two main R scripts for analyzing and forecasting demand data using time series techniques.

## File 1: Time Series Analysis and ARIMA Forecasting

This script performs the following analyses:

1. Data Loading and Preparation
2. Time Series Plot
3. MAE and RMSE Calculation
4. RMSE Graph
5. Trend and Seasonality Analysis
6. ACF and PACF Analysis
7. AIC and BIC Calculation
8. AIC and BIC Graph
9. Best ARIMA Model Selection
10. ARIMA Model Fitting and Forecasting
11. Forecast Plot
12. Forecast Values Printing

## File 2: Time Series Cross-validation

This script performs time series cross-validation to assess the ARIMA model's performance.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have R installed along with the required libraries: forecast, ggplot2, tseries, and stats.
2. Run the scripts in R or RStudio.
3. The scripts will generate various plots and output files in your working directory.

## Data

The scripts use demand data from 2004 to 2023. Ensure your data is in the correct format before running the scripts.

## Output

The scripts will generate several PNG files for visualizations and print various statistics and forecasts to the console.
